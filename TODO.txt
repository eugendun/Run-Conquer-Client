TODO:

+ tiles should flip slower and around 360°. When flipping is done, it should have the color of the conquering team
+ improve hex mesh. Make it more smooth at the corners and on top
+ frazzle the borders of the map
+ add a background (maybe parallax) behind the map
+ let camera move more smooth to ME position
+ let user pan map (should re-center above ME after about five seconds after panning)
+ use pictures of Duong, Eugen and Johannes as avatars and players on map in game
+ don't start flipping, when game starts. Wait a few seconds, until player locations are fix
+ map has to start at world-position (0, 0) so that calculated position of ME in map-space can easily be translated into world-space
+ map-creator should not be child of each map-tile. Instead, each map-tile should just get the created material
+ discuss coloring and design of the App. Flat design?
+ create an App icon
+ hide maptile prefab somewhere far away in the world
