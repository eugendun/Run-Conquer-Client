TODO:

+ map has to start at world-position (0, 0) so that calculated position of ME in map-space can easily be translated into world-space
+ map-creator should not be child of each map-tile. Instead, each map-tile should just get the created material
+ improve hex mesh. Make it more smooth at the corners and on top
+ let camera move more smooth to ME position
+ let user pan map (should re-center above ME after about five seconds after panning)
+ use pictures of Duong, Eugen and Johannes as avatars and players on map in game
+ don't start flipping, when game starts. Wait a few seconds, until player locations are fix
